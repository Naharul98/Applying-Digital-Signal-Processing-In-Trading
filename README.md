# Digital-Signal-Processing-In-Trading
Transform asset price time series into stationary form and apply Discrete Fourier Transform to eliminate noise and identify repeating patterns to exploit and backtest.

# Inspiration from Research Journals
The project was inspired by the following academic journals:
* [Journal 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303849241_Fourier_Analysis_for_Stock_Price_Forecasting_Assumption_and_Evidence)
* [Journal 2](https://www.mesasoftware.com/papers/FourierTransformForTraders.pdf)
* [Journal 3](https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-022808-142909/unrestricted/FullIQPReport7.pdf)
